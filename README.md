# RustRadar
A private Rust cheat that I made for myself. Uses a modified version of a project called RustInterceptor which can be found at https://github.com/LasseSkogland/RustInterceptor/tree/master/RustInterceptor. Packets received from the game server are parsed for entity data (coordinates) drawn on the radar.

This project is now obsolete due to packet encryption.
